Α oron, cir. 11. 225

exsuctae,

Cimon, the son oi Miltiades, was married to his own
sister, Elpinice by name. He says that he will not suf-
fer the name oi the tyrant to be protected by his [i. e.
the speaker’s] popularity. His duties as ambassador are
so faithfully executed by Dion, that the tyrant’s most
cruel name is protected by his popularity. It cannot be
denied that Dionysius is much influenced by the advice
of Dion. How sew are there (Pr. Intr. 477), who un-
dertake the post of ambassador with active-readiness,
and executa its duties with fidelity. Though Dionysius
was much intluenced by Dion’s advice, yet in this mat·
ter, his own private feeling was stronger.
