Bor little has been done to this edition save to edd
Notes on the Lives from Epaminondas (XV), and

· onwards. ALexioon has also been added, which is

believedto be accurate. A Historioai and Geographi·
cel Index completos the additions which have been
made. Itis proper to state thet the editor of the first
edition of this work is not responsible for the addi·

tions now mede. They have been added owing to the
pressing desire of teeohers to possess the complete
work. These additions will be found to be improve-
ments, and serve to render the work as nearly perfeot
as the plan submitted permitted.
