xilla-e. Pridie calendas Aprilis, “ the dey before the cel·
ends ef April, i. e. on the eise of March.'’ Scmewhat similer to the
Olympiade of the Greeks, were the Lustra of the Romans. At the
end of every five years, a cenans, or review of the people, was made,
which was closed with a solemn sacrifice, called Lustrum. This
word, accordingly, ie put for the term of five years—thus duo lustra,
teu years3 decem lustra uidit, he ie fifty years of age. These Lustra,
however, were not, like the Olympiade, used in ¹reclroning dates, but

These¹ months were adopted to the course of the sun, by Julius Cesar,
with the aid of Sosigenes, an astronomos of Alexandria, and distribu· ·

divided into three parte, by Kalends‚ Nonae, and Ides. The first day
wce called Kalendae (a calando) from apriest calling out to the peeple
that it was new meon3 the Ides, which divided tha mouth, derived
their name from the obsoleta verb iduare, to divide ; and the Nonee
