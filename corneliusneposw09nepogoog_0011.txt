PREFAGE.

..ι--ι-ι

Tan English edition of this little work was accom- -

panied by the following brief announcement:
“ Should the plan and execution cf this little volume
meet with the approbation of able instructore, it will

x probably be followed by a similar one 011 selected por-

tions of Xenophon's werke.

“ For the answers to the questions I am principally
indebted to the excellent editions of Cornelius Nepos
by Bremi, Ddhne, and Janmann.

In this American edition the alterations will be found -

tc consist principally in a more full and correct citation
of illustrative passages, in frequent references to ‚the ,
recent reprint of Zumpt's Latin Grammar, to confirm
or silently modify the positious taken, and in the addi-
tion of the notes at the fect of the page, which are re· ’
¹ ferred to by letters of the alphabet.

Many other changes have been made in the correc-

tion of errore, which appear to have been the conse·

’ ,ῳιθηοε of haste, cf which it is hoped this edition will

be comparatively free.

With these brief statements of what theeditor is
responsible for, he leaves this little volume to win for
itself, both with teachers and pupils, the favor which

’ it deserves.
