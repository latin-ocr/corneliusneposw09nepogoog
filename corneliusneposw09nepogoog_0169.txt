Livius was a contemporary of Ennius’s. Aristides
had committed nothing, so sar at least as Ι have heard,

, that should have made him considered to deservo such

[Pr. lntr. C. 10.] a punishment. It was soon seen how
dangerous a thing it was to disputa the first place [in
the govemment] with Themistocles. ln the sixth year
after Aristides was banished, the King os Persia made a
descent upon Graece. A man was writiug that Aristides
should be banished. When Aristides saw'a man wri-
ting that he should be banished for t'en years, he inquired
of him, why he thought that Aristides deserved such a
punishment.
