exsacrsa ou on. 1. rr.
It is certain that Chabrias has fought a battle before Ἰ

· Thebes. It cannot be deuied that Chabrias has marehed

to the assistance of the Boeotians. The rest of the
main-body would not retire. Astatue was erected to
Chabrias, sor having taught his men to kneel down
“ behind their shields and. await the charge of the enemy
with aliue of pointed epears. Chabrias wished tha*
his statue should be represented iu the [kneeling] pos-
ture, which, by his directions, his men had assumed,
and which had gained them tht victory. Iwill not
withdraw till I conquer the whole island.
