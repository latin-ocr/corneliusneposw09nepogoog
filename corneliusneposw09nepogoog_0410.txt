“Annono‘s Gnrrn ann Lirin Saarna—The publication of thiu veluable collection of
classicel school boolu may be regarded aa the presago ol better things in rer ect to the mode of

and hy degrees they lay np a atoclr os knowledge which ie utterly astonrahing to those who have
dragged on mouth elier mouth in the old-sashioued‚ dry, end tediona way os learnIng lan tegre·¹

uMr. Arnold, in sect, has had the good sememadopt the system oi nature. Achil learnt ·
hia own language by imitotmg what he heare, and conatantly repeating it till it iv Iastened in
the memory; in the earne way Mr. A. puts the pupil immediately to work et Exercisea in Latin
and Greek, involeng the elementary princi lez of the language-worda are supplied—the mode
of patting them together ia told the pupil—lie ia shown how the ancienta expressed their idean
and then, by repeating these things again and again-iterum iterumque—the docile pnpil hae
